CryptoDredge v0.9.3 NVIDIA CUDA High Performance miner (Windows )

CryptoDredge is a simple in use and highly optimized cryptocurrency mining software. It takes full advantage of modern NVIDIA graphics cards through the use of unique optimization techniques. We have also devoted great attention to stable power consumption. These benefits, along with the very small DevFee (being just low as 1%), make our product one of the best publicly available miners.

 

Currently supported algorithms are:

 

✔︎ Allium

✔︎ Lyra2REv2

✔︎ Lyra2z

✔︎ NeoScrypt

✔︎ PHI1612

✔︎ Phi2

✔︎ CryptoNight Variants*

 

This miner should work on Windows 7-10 64bit versions with at least 2GB RAM available (though 4GB is high advisable) , and on any NVIDIA based GPU with Compute Capability 5.0 or greater (Maxwell, Pascal). Also please do note that some algorithms like Neoscrypt requieres the virtual memory (also known as swap file) with the same size as the total GPUs vRAM amount.

 

The latest version is CryptoDredge v0.9.3 beta and contains the following optimizations, features and bug fixes:

✔︎ New CryptoNightHaven algorithm

✔︎ Fix issue related to many rejected shares on NiceHash pool when used CryptoNight-like algorithms
